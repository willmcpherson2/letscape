let's say you have a set of definitions. they are not typed. the final "in" will be evaluated.

a = b in
c = d in
e

but what if we evaluated some type checking code? we could do it like this:

1. supply each definition to the type checker, and a program to execute
2. if the type check passes, the program is evaluated
3. if the type check fails, the result is an error message
